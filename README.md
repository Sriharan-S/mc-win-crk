Extract the zip in Desktop and then simply run `take_ownership_and_copy.bat` as administrator.
Note: This file will take ownership of `C:\Windows\System32\Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` and copy and replace the crack files.

If, the batch file couldn't copy it, then it means, the file is being used by some other process.
In that case, you should restart your computer, then run this Batch script as administrator before some other process starts to use it.

It is recommended to turn of internet so, microsoft store will not use the files initially.

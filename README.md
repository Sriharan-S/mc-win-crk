Extract the Folders in `C:/Windows/` Folder. There You Go...

Note:
You might need permission to perform it. So make sure you take ownership of files in
1. `C:\Windows\System32\Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll`
2. `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll`

To take ownership of that file, 
simply run `takeownership.ps1`.
